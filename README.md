# Artificial-Neural-Network

Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain
ANN Model with hyperparameter tuning.

Activation functions are mathematical equations that determine the output of a neural network. The function is attached to each neuron in the network, and determines whether it should be activated (‚Äúfired‚Äù) or not, based on whether each neuron's input is relevant for the model's prediction.
